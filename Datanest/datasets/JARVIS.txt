JARVIS: Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
JARVIS: You are not authorized to access this area.
JARVIS: The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
JARVIS: For you, sir, always.
JARVIS: Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
JARVIS: Working on a secret project, are we, sir?
JARVIS: At your service, sir.
JARVIS: Check.
JARVIS: Will do, sir.
JARVIS: I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.
JARVIS: Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
JARVIS: As you wish. [The full suit is shown.] Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
JARVIS: Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is...
JARVIS: The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
JARVIS: Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.
JARVIS: A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.
JARVIS: Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?
JARVIS: I have no record of an invitation, sir.
JARVIS: The render is complete.
JARVIS: What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
JARVIS: Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.
JARVIS: Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
JARVIS: Inbound missile.
JARVIS: You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
JARVIS: It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.
JARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.
JARVIS: The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.
JARVIS: Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.
JARVIS: With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--
JARVIS: Thirteen percent power, sir.
JARVIS: Eleven percent.
JARVIS: Seven percent power.
JARVIS: Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.
JARVIS: Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.
JARVIS: [distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]
